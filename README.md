## Brogram - A Workout Planner (React.js & FantaCSS) ***


Using React.js to build a Workout Planner that lets users follow a prescribed workout and track their progress. This will level up my skills in React components, state management, and hooks.

1. Full CRUD functionality (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
2. Smooth UI with FantaCSS
3. Fully responsive to screen size
4. Hosted & deployed online

## Modifications to enhance the original 
1.  Added a dark/light theme toggle, fixed to upper right of view port.
2.  Ideas for future modifications are as follows:
    1.  Employ a SQL (or non SQL) database, rather than local storage.
    2.  Convert to a mobile app, using React Native or Flutter.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
