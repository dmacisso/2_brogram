# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Project 2: Workout Planner (React.js & FantaCSS)
Now, we jump into React.js and build a Workout Planner that lets users follow a prescribed workout and track their progress. This will level up your skills in React components, state management, and hooks.

1. Full CRUD functionality (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
2. Smooth UI with FantaCSS
3. Hosted & deployed online
